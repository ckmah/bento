def _count_neighbors(

):
    """Build nearest neighbor index for points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : pd.DataFrame
        Points dataframe. Must have columns "x", "y", and "gene".
    n_genes : int
        Number of genes in overall dataset. Used to initialize unique gene counts.
    query_points : pd.DataFrame, optional
        Points to query. If None, use points_df. Default None.
    n_neighbors : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to consider per gene.
    agg : "gene", "binary", None
        Whether to aggregate nearest neighbors counts. "Gene" aggregates counts by gene, whereas "binary" counts neighbors only once per point. If None, return neighbor counts for each point.
         Default "gene".
    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame or dict of dicts
        If agg is True, returns a DataFrame with columns "gene", "neighbor", and "count".
        If agg is False, returns a list of dicts, one for each point. Dict keys are gene names, values are counts.
